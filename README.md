### Interview Question: Pure Pursuit Algorithm Implementation

In this task, you are asked to implement a **pure pursuit algorithm** for a pursuer vehicle trying to follow and capture an evader vehicle. The goal of the algorithm is to compute the control commands (velocity and heading) for the pursuer such that it can follow and eventually get within a specified capture distance of the evader. Additionally, you will implement a distance check to determine when the pursuer is close enough to capture the evader.

#### Task Overview:
1. **Pure Pursuit Algorithm**: Implement the logic for a pursuer to track an evader. The function will output the velocity and heading commands needed for the pursuer to minimize the distance to the evader.
2. **Distance Check**: Implement a function that checks if the distance between the pursuer and evader is within the specified `CAPTURE_DISTANCE`. If the pursuer is within this distance, the simulation should stop, and the program should print a message indicating that the evader has been captured.
3. **Simulation Loop**: The pursuer and evader are simulated over a fixed time period, and their positions are updated at each time step. Your task is to ensure that the pursuer attempts to minimize the distance to the evader by adjusting its velocity and heading.

### Problem Breakdown:
1. **Pure Pursuit Algorithm** (`pure_pursuit_algorithm`):
   - This function takes in the current positions of the evader and pursuer as well as a time step (`dt`). The pursuer's velocity is fixed at 10.0 by default, but the heading command needs to be calculated based on the relative positions of the evader and the pursuer.
   - Implement a strategy that computes the correct heading (`heading_cmd`) such that the pursuer can move toward the evader.

2. **Distance Check** (`is_close`):
   - This function computes the Euclidean distance between the evader and pursuer. If the distance is less than or equal to the `CAPTURE_DISTANCE`, return `true`; otherwise, return `false`.
   - The function uses the `CAPTURE_DISTANCE` constant to determine if the pursuer has successfully captured the evader.

3. **Simulation**:
   - The simulation runs for a given number of steps, updating the positions of the evader and pursuer at each step using the `move` function.
   - The evader moves with a fixed velocity (`EVADER_VELOCITY`), while the pursuer moves based on the commands generated by your `pure_pursuit_algorithm`.

### Requirements:
- Implement the `pure_pursuit_algorithm` function to compute the correct heading for the pursuer to move toward the evader.
- Implement the `is_close` function to compute the distance between the evader and pursuer and determine if the evader is captured.
- Ensure the simulation loop operates correctly, terminating when the evader is captured or the end of the simulation time is reached.

### Additional Information:
- The `move` function updates the position of the evader and pursuer based on their current heading and velocity.
- The program saves the position data of both the evader and pursuer to a CSV file, which can be used for analysis and visualization of the pursuit behavior.


### Compiling code 
In terminal do the following command
```
./run_code.sh
```
It will compile the cpp code and output a csv and a plot showing the trajectory of the pursuer and the evader
